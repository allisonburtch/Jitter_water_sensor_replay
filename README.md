Lady of Shallott is a DIY analog water sensor using Arduino and Max/MSP. When the doll head is pressed
into the water, a woman's face appears to go underwater on the screen, according to the water level
in which the doll is pressed.

It was loosely inspired by this scene in Anne of Greene Gables,
where Anne almosts drowns when reading poetry in a canoe.

The analog read from Arduino went into Max/MSP, which then looped through
specific frames when theh doll head raises the water level to each
stainless steel wire. Stainless steel wire was the best material because it didnâ€™t corrode. 
I used other wires previously. Some sort of chemical reaction was still created.

Genius moment: blowing up a balloon in the doll head insuring its buoyancy.
