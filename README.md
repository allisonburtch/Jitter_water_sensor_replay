Lady of Shallott is a DIY analog water sensor using Arduino and Max/MSP.
 It was loosely inspired by this scene in Anne of Greene Gables,
 where Anne almosts drowns when reading poetry in a canoe.

The analog read from Arduino went into Max/MSP, which then looped through
specific frames when theh doll head raises the water level to each
stainless steel wire. 

Genius moment: blowing up a balloon in the doll head insuring its buoyancy.
